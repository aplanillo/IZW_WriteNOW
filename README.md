# IZW_WriteNOW

The writeNOW meetings were created as an informal space where we meet to focus on scientific writing and where students can boost there writing skills. Standard meetings are usually two hours long, and they consist of three main parts:

- A first short part dedicated to improve general writing skills: flash lectures about theory of scientific writing, exercises, tips and tricks, etc. 

- A second part where any student is given the oportunity to expose a specific problem and receive recommendations from the group.

- A third and main part that consist on personal time to write the respective projects/papers. At the start of the personal time, each person settles a goal for the meeting and starts working on their writing. After one hour, we do a short break and reassess the personal goals. This way, we boost writing at the same time that we learn how to estimate the time required for each task. 

- If needed, there can be also an exchange or questions at the end of the meeting. 

WriteNOW meetings are open to all members of the Ecological Dynamics group, plus some students from related groups. Students (phd, master, bachelor) are specially encouraged to participate, as writing is a necessary part of the scientific career and this is the optimal environment to learn, discuss and improve the writing of their theses. 

In this repository you will find several folders containing the main topics that were addressed during the meetings (lectures, exercises, recommendations and tips and tricks). Please, keep in mind that available material was created from a mix of multiple sources, including, but not limited to, books, websites and personal experience. Thus, this is not an exhaustive course on scientific writing, just a space to practice and boost your skills. Any constructive criticism is welcome and we'll be incorporated to future meetings.
